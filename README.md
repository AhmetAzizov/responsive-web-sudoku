Responsive Web Sudoku
Created by Ahmet Azizov.

This is a web sudoku game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My main motivation for creating this project was to leverage my CSS and JavaScript skills alongside
creating my version of one of my favorite games.
This is an updated version of my previous sudoku game. The main difference between this version is, It is
made to be responsive and work on all screen sizes. 
The biggest challenge I faced while working on this project was creating the "engine" which generates
a new unique game whenever the user presses the start button.
The other challenge I faced was making it responsive which is the main goal of this version of the project.

This project can be run and tested by simply visiting the following live GitHub page:
